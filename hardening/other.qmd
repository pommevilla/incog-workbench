### Enforce Group Requirement

By default, anyone who can successfully authenticate on the system can use the IDE. You can get more control over who's able to log into the system by creating a group such as `rstudio-users` and instructing RStudio to limit access to that group.

```ini
# /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf
auth-required-user-group=rstudio-users
```
