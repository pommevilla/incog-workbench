## Access and Security

Application security is complex; there are many aspects to consider when deploying RStudio into your environment, and you should evaluate each of these areas based on your deployment scenario.  These include:

* Network port, address, and IP access rules
* Browser considerations (Frame origin, cookies, and other browser compatibility)
* SSL 
* Server account and permissions
* Proxy configurations
