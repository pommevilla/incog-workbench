## Database

RStudio supports multiple database options. Currently, the supported databases are SQLite and PostgreSQL. When running RStudio Workbench in a load balanced configuration, you *must* use a PostgreSQL database, as SQLite is insufficient for managing state between multiple nodes.

The contents of the database are described in the [Data Dictionary](../data_dictionary/data_dictionary.qmd) appendix.
